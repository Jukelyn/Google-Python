# Google's Python Class

Today I learned that Google has an introductory Python course that they made and it seemed cooled I figured that I might as well check it out.

It's available for free [here](https://developers.google.com/edu/python).

I have already done a bunch of Python but let's see what this is about. Thanks in advanced to Nick Parlante for creating the material for this course.
